<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">In the year 8 CE, on the cold edge of the Black Sea, a Roman poet found himself far from home, writing under conditions he never expected.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ovid had been exiled from Rome—the city where he had built his career, and the audience that had made him famous—by order of the emperor Augustus. The reason was never fully explained. Ovid himself called it a "mistake." But exile, in Rome, was rarely accidental. It was a way of removing someone whose voice had become inconvenient.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The work Ovid completed during that exile was The Metamorphoses, and it's a poem that asks us to rethink some very basic assumptions about how the world works.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Across fifteen books, it returns again and again to the idea that nothing stays fixed. Gods, humans, animals, even the landscape itself are constantly shifting shape. Transformation isn't an exception in this poem—it's the rule. Change, not stability, is what organizes the world.</p>
<p class="dialogue">To explore that idea, Ovid gathers together the myths of the ancient world and links them into a single, continuous narrative. Many of these stories were already well known. What Ovid does differently is place transformation at their center.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Narcissus wastes away, transfixed by his own reflection, until his body becomes a flower. Daphne escapes Apollo by turning into a tree, choosing transformation as a form of survival. Arachne challenges Athena with her skill, and is turned into a spider, condemned to weave forever.</p>
<p class="dialogue">And then there is Orpheus, whose music is so powerful it reaches into the underworld itself. He nearly brings his wife back from the dead, and then loses her again. When he is torn apart, his head drifts down the river, still singing.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Again and again, the pattern is the same. Bodies fail. Power asserts itself. But something remains.</p>
<p class="dialogue">By the end of The Metamorphoses, Ovid has carried his reader from the creation of the cosmos to his own historical moment—to the reign of the emperor who exiled him. And in the final lines, he allows himself a rare moment of directness. He claims that neither fire, nor sword, nor time itself will destroy what he has written.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The poem ends with a single word.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Vivam.</p>
<p class="dialogue">I shall live.</p>

<p class="scene-heading first">EXT. UNDERWORLD, WHARF — NIGHT</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin had been walking for what felt like a very long time.</p>
<p class="dialogue">His parents were somewhere ahead of him. They had to be. Every soul he spoke to had heard the same rumors—two living people, passing through the Underworld—but no one had seen them. No one knew who had brought them here, or why, or where they had gone.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Now he was picking his way across the slick cobblestones of a nameless port town, rain falling in a thin, cold drizzle. Lanterns burned in the windows with flames that gave no warmth. The dead passed him without looking, intent on their own errands, as though death were merely another kind of living.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin was growing tired. Soon he would need food, and somewhere to rest. But more than either of those, he needed help. A friend. Someone willing to point him in the right direction. The dead, it seemed, had no time for such things.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The houses leaned together along the street like weary men. Benjamin was quite sure he had passed them before.</p>
<p class="dialogue">He was about to turn back when he noticed a narrow lane branching off to the left, sloping gently downward—toward the port. Sailors heard things. Sailors always had.</p>
<p class="dialogue">At the water's edge, the buildings fell away as if a curtain had been drawn back. A grey-green sea stretched to the horizon, and pale shapes moved beneath its surface, slow and distant, like ghosts of submarines.</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was when he heard the music.</p>
<p class="dialogue">A guitar, plucked slowly. And a voice—deep and rich, seeming to rise from somewhere below the earth itself. The melody was simple, and sad. Benjamin followed it to the end of the wharf, where a figure sat upon a coil of rope, playing.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The figure wore a deep hood that concealed all but a large, faintly green nose and two pale, oversized hands moving gently over the strings. A raven perched nearby on a wooden post, watching Benjamin with a single, shining eye.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The music stopped.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You look lost.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The figure set the guitar aside.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Have you wandered far?</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Very far.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Yes. A journey few attempt while still alive.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He paused, as though listening to something Benjamin could not hear.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You are looking for your parents.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">You know where they are?</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know how to find out.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">One pale hand lifted and gestured toward the sea. Out in the gloom, a ship lay at anchor—black hull, black sails, lanterns burning with a sickly green fire.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Naglfar. Her captain is Bartholomew Roberts. He and his crew possess something that does not belong to them. A seeing stone.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">What's a seeing stone?</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">For a moment, the hooded figure said nothing.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">An object that allows a skilled practitioner to see what is—no matter how near, or how far.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Then you could tell me where my parents are.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The figure inclined his head.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did they steal it from you?</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not from me. From a creature of the deep—older than the world. But that is not your concern. Your concern is your parents.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">He turned back toward the sea.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bring me the stone.</p>
<p class="scene-heading">EXT. UNDERWORLD, PORT — CONTINUOUS</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin found a boat—little more than a raft fitted with oars—and pushed out across the spectral water. It was warm and thick, more like oil than sea, glowing faintly beneath the surface. He did his best not to imagine what might be moving below.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Naglfar loomed larger as he drew near. A great galleon, ancient and barnacled, its sails hanging limp in the windless air. And then he saw the hull.</p>
<p class="dialogue">It was studded with fingernails—thousands of them, yellowed and curling, pressed into the wood like scales.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin caught hold of the anchor chain and began to climb.</p>
<p class="dialogue">---</p>
<p class="scene-heading">INT. RABBIT'S HOUSE — DAY</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pooh rose from the table and said, in a rather sticky voice:</p>
<p class="character">POOH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Goodbye, Rabbit. I must be going.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And he started out the front door. Pooh's head reached the outdoors and his feet dangled indoors, but his middle got stuck in the middle.</p>
<p class="character">POOH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bother! It all comes from not having a big enough front door.</p>
<p class="character">RABBIT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nonsense! It all comes from eating too much!</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And he hurried out his back door to fetch Christopher Robin. Pooh spotted Owl sitting on a branch.</p>
<p class="character">OWL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello, Pooh. Are you stuck?</p>
<p class="character">POOH</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh no! I'm just resting.</p>
<p class="character">OWL</p>
<p class="dialogue">Pooh, you are definitively stuck. You are a wedged bear in a great tightness. This situation calls for an expert!</p>
<p class="character">GOPHER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did someone say expert? Gopher's my name, digging's my game. The problem with this door is that it has a bear in it.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And he popped back down into his hole. Before long, Rabbit returned with Christopher Robin.</p>
<p class="character">CHRISTOPHER ROBIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Silly old bear. There is only one thing to do. We will just have to wait for you to get thin!</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Eeyore made gloomy predictions about how long it would take.</p>
<p class="character">EEYORE</p>
<p class="dialogue">It could be days. Maybe weeks. Even months.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Rabbit grew tired of seeing Pooh's bottom where his front door used to be.</p>
<p class="character">RABBIT</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh, why did I ever invite that bear to lunch!</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Finally, one morning, Rabbit leaned against Pooh's bottom. It moved.</p>
<p class="character">RABBIT</p>
<p class="dialogue">He budged! Hooray! He bidged! He badged! He boodged! Christopher Robin!</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Everyone took hold and pulled, and with a great pop, Pooh sailed through the air and landed headfirst in a honey tree — which was a very good place for a bear to be.</p>
<p class="dialogue">That night, back at home, Pooh heard a strange sound at his front door. And being a bear of very little brain, he decided to let the strange sound in. A big, bouncy creature bounded through and knocked Pooh flat on his back.</p>
<p class="character">TIGGER</p>
<p class="dialogue">Hello! I'm Tigger. T-I-double-guh-Rrr. Glad to meet ya.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">And with that, he went bouncing back out the door and into the night.</p>
